Ezerovo
============

The font family Ezerovo started as an attempt to update [Erewhon](https://ctan.org/pkg/erewhon?lang=en) - a project of CTAN (The Comprehensive TEX Archive Network), based on [Heuristica GitHub](https://github.com/moyogo/evristika), [Heuristica CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/heuristica) and [Utopia](https://ctan.org/pkg/utopia). Because the changes went far beyond the original plans to add local forms of Cyrillic (Bulgarian form, Serbian form, Macedonian form) and practically covered all aspects of the font, as well as in accordance with the requirements of the SIL Open Font License for the new name of the project when implementing changes, I decided that it would be most reasonable for the project to take a new path with its new name Ezerovo and its new place of development - GitHub.  
The project is in its beginning. Any contributions are well-come and highly appreciated.  
  
History 
-------

The Ezerovo font project (Copyright (c) 2024 Stefan Peev) is based on the Erewhon font project (Copyright (c) 2012-2014 Michael Sharpe). The Erewhon font project is based on the Heuristica package (Copyright (c) 2008-2012 Andrey V. Panov), which is based in turn on Utopia (Copyright (c) 1989, 1991 Adobe Systems Incorporated). Erewhon adds a number of new features — small caps in all styles rather than just regular, added figure styles (proportional, inferior, numerator, denominator) and superior letters. The size is 6% smaller than Heuristica, matching that of UtopiaStd.
The Ezerovo font project (Copyright (c) 2024 Stefan Peev) is actually a totally new project compare to Erewhon because the Ezerovo font project integrates Regular and Bold versions on one hand and Italic and Bold Italic on the other hand into compatable font masters. It is not only a chance to generate new styles (Medium, SemiBold, Medium Italic, SemiBold Italic), but it also garantee that the glyphs with identical structure will be ruled as referance elements into the whole font project.
