Ezerovo
============

Font family Ezerovo is based on the project Erewhon. Ezerovo extends the multilanguage coverage of Erewhon and changes the geometry of some glyphs. It include also new styles (Medium, SemiBold) as well as a variable font format.  
The project is in its beginning. Any contributions are well-come and highly appreciated.  

History 
-------

The [Libertinus font project](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus)
began as a fork of the [Linux Libertine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Libertine) and Linux Biolinum fonts.
Libertinus was forked from the [5.3.0 (2012-07-02) release](https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxlibertine/files/linuxlibertine/) of the Linux Libertine fonts.
The original impetus was to add an OpenType math companion to the Libertine font families.
Over time it grew into to a full-fledged fork addressing many of the bugs in the Libertine fonts.

Hat-tip to Frédéric Wang for coming up with the name "Libertinus".

Thanks to Khaled Hosny who was the primary contributor and maintainer from 2012–2020.
If you like this font, please thank and even consider sponsoring him!

In 2020, Khaled passed the role of maintainer on to Caleb Maclennan.

In 2022 Stefan Peev started a new project, Common Serif, which further develops Libertinus Serif.
