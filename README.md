Ezerovo
============

Font family Ezerovo is based on the project [Erewhon](https://ctan.org/pkg/erewhon?lang=en). Ezerovo extends the multilanguage coverage of Erewhon and changes the geometry of some glyphs. It includes also new styles (Medium, SemiBold) as well as a variable font format.  
The project is in its beginning. Any contributions are well-come and highly appreciated.  

History 
-------

The Erewhon font project (Copyright (c) 2012-2014 Michael Sharpe) is based on the Heuristica package (Copyright (c) 2008-2012 Andrey V. Panov), which is based in turn on Utopia (Copyright (c) 1989, 1991 Adobe Systems Incorporated). Erewhon adds a number of new features — small caps in all styles rather than just regular, added figure styles (proportional, inferior, numerator, denominator) and superior letters. The size is 6% smaller than Heuristica, matching that of UtopiaStd.
Ezerovo font (Copyright (c) 2024 Stefan Peev) is actually a totally new project.
